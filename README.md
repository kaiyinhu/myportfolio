# myportfolio
This is my portfolio and my homework to fullstack web class in udacity

This project contains 1 index.html file and two folders, which are css and img. The css folder contains bootstrap css for me
to develop using embedded bootstrap features. Also there is a custom css for doing custom fonts as well as responsive design.
When the browser size <500 px, the horizontal line will disappear, and the size of link will increase for users to have better
click experience.
